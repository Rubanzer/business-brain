# Personalized Channel Partner Outreach Emails

**From:** Krishna Jindal, MonoEdge
**Date:** February 2026

## 1. Nilesh Arora — AVCI (AddValue Consulting Inc.)
**To:** info@avci-lean.com | +91 9824009792
**Subject:** AVCI's lean gains + real-time AI monitoring = sticky results for your clients

Hi Nilesh,

I came across AVCI's work on lean manufacturing — the IIM-A pedigree, 25+ years across 20 countries, and the Government of India "Best Consulting Organisation" award speak for themselves.

I run MonoEdge, and we've built Business Brain — an AI-powered analytics platform built specifically for manufacturing plants. We connect to ERP, SCADA, and even Google Sheets, and give plant managers autonomous anomaly detection, natural language data queries, and proactive alerts — all without needing a data team.

Here's why I think this is relevant to AVCI: the #1 challenge after a lean engagement is **sustaining the gains**. Plants drift back within months. Business Brain acts as a 24/7 watchdog on the KPIs you set up — if OEE drops, inventory spikes, or cycle times creep up, the system flags it immediately.

**What I'm proposing:**
- You recommend and implement Business Brain at your client sites as a "lean sustenance" layer
- Revenue share on every plant that adopts
- Your clients see measurable, lasting ROI from your engagements — which means repeat business and referrals for AVCI

Given your Ahmedabad base and Gujarat's manufacturing density, even 5-10 plants would be a strong pilot.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week to explore this?

Best,
Krishna Jindal

## 2. Narayanan Sundaram — Industrial Technical Consultant (ITC), Raipur
**To:** itechc@gmail.com | +91 99930 29536
**Subject:** Fellow Raipur industrialist — AI analytics for steel plants

Hi Narayanan,

I'm Krishna, based out of the Raipur-Chhattisgarh industrial belt myself — my family runs a steel manufacturing operation here.

I've been following ITC's work — 22+ years and 250+ projects in sponge iron, pellet plants, SMS, and rolling mills is an incredible track record, especially in this region where steel is the backbone of the economy.

I've built an AI platform called Business Brain at my company MonoEdge, that sits on top of a plant's existing data — ERP, SCADA, production logs, even spreadsheets — and provides real-time anomaly detection, natural language queries ("what was the energy consumption per ton last week vs this week?"), and proactive alerts.

**Why this matters for ITC's clients:** After you commission or optimize a plant, the operators need ongoing visibility into performance. Business Brain gives them a live dashboard and AI copilot without needing a data engineering team.

Since we're both in Raipur and serve the same steel ecosystem, I think there's a natural partnership here:
- You recommend Business Brain during your consulting/EPC engagements
- We share revenue on every plant that adopts
- Your clients get a "smart plant" layer on top of ITC's engineering work

Happy to meet in person — I'm based right here in Raipur. Coffee this week?

Warm regards,
Krishna Jindal

## 3. Jayen Kotecha — Perfext Consulting Group, Rajkot
**To:** info@perfext.in | +91 98244 59041
**Subject:** 150+ industries served — now give them real-time AI analytics

Hi Jayen,

28 years in business excellence and 150+ industries served from Rajkot — that's a distribution network most SaaS companies would dream of.

I'm Krishna from MonoEdge. We've built an AI platform for manufacturing plants that connects to any data source (ERP, SCADA, spreadsheets) and provides anomaly detection, natural language queries, and proactive alerts — all purpose-built for factory floors.

**Here's my pitch:** Rajkot's engineering and auto-parts cluster is one of the densest in India, but most of these plants still run on Excel and gut feeling for data decisions. When Perfext implements ZED certification or lean systems, Business Brain can be the tech layer that sustains those improvements — giving plant owners real-time visibility without hiring data analysts.

**The partnership:**
- Recommend Business Brain at Perfext's client sites
- Revenue share on every plant adoption
- Your lean/quality implementations get sustained by automated monitoring — better outcomes, happier clients, more referrals

The Rajkot-Morbi-Jamnagar belt alone could be 50+ plants. Would 15 minutes this week work to discuss?

Best,
Krishna Jindal

## 4. Dr. Ashok Puri — Kaizen Guru
**To:** drapuri@kaizenguru.in | +91 98100 30260
**Subject:** Kaizen + AI = continuous improvement that actually sustains

Dr. Puri,

30 years of driving Kaizen and lean transformations across India's factories — respect. I've read about your work on kaizenguru.in and your philosophy that Kaizen is not a project but a culture.

I couldn't agree more — which is exactly why I built Business Brain at MonoEdge. It's an AI platform that connects to a plant's existing data (ERP, SCADA, Google Sheets) and provides real-time anomaly detection, natural language queries, and proactive alerts.

**Why I'm reaching out to you specifically:** The biggest gap in Kaizen implementations is the feedback loop. A consultant drives a transformation, leaves, and within 6 months the plant drifts back. Business Brain is the always-on Kaizen watchdog — if a process deviates from the standards you set, the AI catches it immediately and alerts the plant team.

Think of it as **Kaizen with memory**.

**Partnership idea:**
- You introduce Business Brain as the "sustenance layer" in your Kaizen engagements
- Revenue share per plant
- Your client retention improves because results stick — which is great for your brand and repeat engagements

You travel nationally to factory sites — this would work at any plant you visit. Open to a call?

Best regards,
Krishna Jindal

## 5. Shardul Patel — 4C Consulting, Ahmedabad
**To:** info@4cpl.com | +91 99041 03636
**Subject:** 4C's 200+ projects + Business Brain = recurring revenue from existing clients

Hi Shardul,

4C Consulting's track record is impressive — 200+ projects, NPC-certified lean consultants, ZED certification partner, and deep roots in Gujarat's MSME ecosystem.

I'm Krishna from MonoEdge. We've built an AI-powered analytics platform for manufacturing plants — plug it into ERP, SCADA, or even Google Sheets, and plant managers get anomaly detection, natural language data queries, and proactive alerts.

**Two reasons this is especially relevant for 4C:**

1. **Government subsidy channel:** You already help MSMEs access ZED and lean subsidies. Business Brain's Industry 4.0 capabilities can qualify plants for additional SAMARTH Udyog or Digital India subsidies — another value-add in your toolkit.

2. **Recurring revenue:** Consulting is project-based. By embedding Business Brain at your client sites, you earn ongoing revenue share — turning one-time engagements into annuity income.

With your team (Dr. Jigar, Sachin, Devanshi) covering everything from ISO to strategy, Business Brain fits naturally as the digital layer on top.

Worth a 15-minute call to explore? Happy to visit your Ahmedabad office.

Best,
Krishna Jindal

## 6. Nirav Trivedi — Greendot Management Solutions, Valsad
**To:** nirav@mygreendot.co.in | +91 9825566009
**Subject:** Greendot's 200+ projects + AI monitoring = next-level client value

Hi Nirav,

25 years in Lean Six Sigma and 200+ projects — Greendot has clearly built a strong practice from Valsad serving Gujarat's industrial corridor.

I'm Krishna from MonoEdge. We've built an AI platform that monitors manufacturing data in real time — connecting to ERP, SCADA, production sheets — and provides anomaly detection, NL queries, and alerts. Purpose-built for the factory floor.

**The gap I keep hearing from consultants like you:** Post-engagement, plants lack the tools to sustain improvements. Operators go back to firefighting. OEE slides. Greendot gets called back for the same issues.

Business Brain solves this — it's the digital sustenance layer for your Lean Six Sigma work. Real-time monitoring on the metrics you define, automated alerts when things drift, and a chatbot that answers any data question in plain language.

**Partnership model:**
- Recommend/implement at your client sites
- Revenue share per plant
- Your consulting outcomes become measurably durable

Gujarat's chemical, pharma, and textile belt around Valsad-Surat is perfectly suited. Open to a call?

Regards,
Krishna Jindal

## 7. Shailesh Oak — IDOS Consultants LLP, Thane
**To:** (via idosconsultants.com/contact.html) | +91 9930998288
**Subject:** IDOS + AI analytics = lean gains that stick at your client plants

Hi Shailesh,

IDOS Consultants' work on lean manufacturing, work-study, and warehouse management for auto and FMCG plants in western India caught my attention.

I'm building an AI platform called Business Brain at my company MonoEdge that connects to factory data (ERP, SCADA, spreadsheets) and gives plant teams real-time anomaly detection, natural language queries, and proactive alerts.

**The problem I'm solving is one you've probably seen:** after a lean transformation, plants lack the daily monitoring tools to hold the gains. Business Brain acts as a 24/7 digital lean auditor — tracking the metrics you set up and flagging deviations instantly.

For IDOS, this means:
- Your clients sustain results long after your engagement ends
- You can offer it as an add-on service (with revenue share)
- Better client outcomes = stronger case studies and referrals

The Thane-Pune-Mumbai industrial corridor has hundreds of plants that would benefit. Would 15 minutes work this week?

Krishna Jindal

## 8. D&V Business Consulting, Ahmedabad
**To:** sales@dvconsulting.co.in | +91 9824009829
**Subject:** Add AI-powered analytics to your OpEx toolkit for MSMEs

Hi,

D&V Business Consulting's work on operational excellence and Lean Six Sigma for MSMEs across Gujarat — with offices in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Mumbai, and Jaipur — shows serious reach.

I'm Krishna from MonoEdge. We've built an AI analytics platform for manufacturing plants. It connects to any data source (ERP, SCADA, Google Sheets) and gives plant managers real-time anomaly detection, plain-English data queries, and proactive alerts — no data team required.

**Why MSMEs specifically need this:** They can't afford dedicated BI teams or expensive analytics platforms. Business Brain is built for the mid-market — affordable, easy to connect, and purpose-built for factory floors.

**Partnership:**
- Recommend Business Brain at D&V client sites as the "digital layer" of your OpEx engagement
- Revenue share on every plant that adopts
- D&V's MSME clients get enterprise-grade analytics at SME pricing

Your Gujarat-Rajasthan-Maharashtra footprint is exactly our target market. Open to a quick call?

## 9. Yogesh Vaghani — Vedzen Institute, Pune
**To:** (via vedzen.com/vedzen-contact)
**Subject:** Vedzen's Pune industrial network + AI manufacturing analytics

Hi Yogesh,

Your work with Vedzen Institute — building what's been called a "mini Japan" in Pune's industrial belt through Kaizen, Lean, and TOC consulting — is impressive. The DCCIA network connection and nearly 20 years in Pune's auto and engineering cluster gives you unmatched distribution.

I'm Krishna from MonoEdge. We've built an AI platform for manufacturing plants that provides real-time anomaly detection, natural language data queries, and proactive alerts by connecting to existing plant data (ERP, SCADA, spreadsheets).

**Pune's auto belt is perfect for this:** Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers need real-time visibility into quality, OEE, and delivery performance. Business Brain gives them that without a dedicated analytics team.

**What I'm proposing:**
- Vedzen recommends Business Brain as part of its consulting engagements
- Revenue share on every plant that adopts
- Your Lean/TOC improvements get monitored 24/7 by AI — sustaining the gains you deliver

Given your network in Pune-Chakan-Pimpri-Chinchwad, this could scale quickly. Would you be open to discussing?

Best regards,
Krishna Jindal

## 10. TechnoSysCon, Pune (Chinchwad)
**To:** technosyscon@gmail.com | +91 20 2749 0009 / +91 9423005866
**Subject:** 15 years in Pune's manufacturing belt — let's add AI analytics to your offering

Hi,

TechnoSysCon has been consulting on ISO, Lean, TPM, and TQM in Pune's Chinchwad manufacturing hub for over 15 years — you clearly know the auto and engineering plants here inside out.

I'm Krishna from MonoEdge. We've built an AI analytics platform for manufacturing — it connects to ERP, SCADA, or even spreadsheets and provides anomaly detection, natural language queries, and proactive alerts.

**Why this fits your practice:** After you implement ISO/TPM systems, plants need ongoing data monitoring to maintain compliance and performance. Business Brain automates that — tracking KPIs, flagging deviations, and giving plant managers instant answers to data questions.

**Partnership model:**
- Recommend Business Brain during your consulting engagements
- Revenue share per plant
- Your TPM/ISO implementations become measurably sustainable

Chinchwad-Pimpri alone has 4,000+ manufacturing units. Happy to meet in person — I can visit your Chinchwad office. Would next week work?

Best,
Krishna Jindal
